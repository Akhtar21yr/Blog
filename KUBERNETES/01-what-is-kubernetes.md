# What is Kubernetes?

![Kubernetes Logo](../assets/kubernetes/kubernetes-logo.webp)

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and has become the de facto standard for container orchestration.

## Key Features of Kubernetes

### 1. **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**
Kubernetes automates the deployment of applications, ensuring that updates and changes are rolled out seamlessly. If something goes wrong, it can automatically roll back to a previous state.

### 2. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**
Kubernetes provides built-in service discovery and load balancing, allowing applications to communicate with each other reliably and distribute traffic evenly across containers.

### 3. **Storage Orchestration**
Kubernetes can automatically mount and manage various storage systems, such as local storage, cloud storage services (e.g., AWS, GCP), and network storage systems.

### 4. **Self-Healing**
Kubernetes monitors the health of applications and automatically restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die, and kills containers that don’t respond to user-defined health checks.

### 5. **Secret and Configuration Management**
Kubernetes allows you to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, and configuration details. This information can be deployed and updated without rebuilding your container images.

### 6. **Horizontal Scaling**
Kubernetes supports automatic horizontal scaling of applications based on CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics, ensuring applications can handle increased load.

### 7. **Declarative Configuration**
Kubernetes uses declarative configuration files for defining the desired state of applications and infrastructure. This makes it easy to version control and automate deployment processes.

## How Kubernetes Works

Kubernetes operates through a master-slave architecture, where the master node controls and manages the cluster, and worker nodes run the containerized applications. It uses various components like pods, services, deployments, and namespaces to organize and manage containerized workloads.

### Setting Up Kubernetes

1. **Install Kubernetes:**
   - Kubernetes can be installed on various environments, including local machines, cloud platforms, and on-premises data centers. Popular tools like Minikube, kubeadm, and managed services like GKE, EKS, and AKS simplify the setup process.

2. **Deploy Applications:**
   - Define your application’s deployment using YAML configuration files and apply them using the `kubectl` command-line tool.

3. **Manage Resources:**
   - Use `kubectl` commands to manage and monitor your cluster, scale applications, and handle updates.

4. **Monitor and Secure:**
   - Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to observe your cluster’s performance. Use Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and network policies to secure your applications.

### Example Use Case

Consider an e-commerce company that needs to deploy a microservices-based application. Using Kubernetes, they can:

1. **Deploy Microservices:**
   - Define each microservice in a separate YAML file and deploy them as pods.

2. **Service Discovery:**
   - Use Kubernetes services to enable communication between microservices and handle load balancing.

3. **Scale Automatically:**
   - Set up horizontal pod autoscaling to manage traffic spikes during peak shopping periods.

4. **Monitor and Heal:**
   - Use Kubernetes self-healing capabilities to automatically restart failed containers and monitor the overall health of the application.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes is a powerful and flexible platform for managing containerized applications at scale. Its features for automation, self-healing, and scalability make it an essential tool for modern DevOps practices and cloud-native applications.
